          Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! I am a driven professional with a foundation in ICT from Walter Sisulu University, supplemented by two Python certificates and invaluable experience gained at Samsung Innovation Campus. After graduating with an Advanced Diploma in ICT in Application Development, I embarked on a fulfilling journey in the software development industry. Currently, I'm pursuing my dreams and advancing my career at Capaciti UVU Africa, where I specialize in crafting innovative software solutions.
          <br /><br />
          I became a full stack developer because I am passionate about creating innovative solutions and improving user experiences. The most rewarding aspect of my profession is collaborating with talented teams to solve complex problems and deliver high-quality software that meets users' needs. I value communication and teamwork, and I thrive in environments where I can contribute my skills to assist both people and the company in achieving their goals.
